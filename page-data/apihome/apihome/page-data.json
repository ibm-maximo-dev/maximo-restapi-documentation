The api is `GET /oslc/systeminfo`.\n\n#### Who Am I (whoami)\n\nThis api provides the profile json for the logged in user.

The api is `GET /oslc/apimeta`.\n\nThe metadata for each Object structure includes - the schema information as well as the available queries (saved queries). Additionally it provides the creation api url and the (security) authorization application name.
