Any updating of the resources properties including adding, updating or **deleting** child objects is done under the update API for the resource. Deleting the resource (object structure root MBO) can be done by using the following sample API:\n \n```\nDELETE /oslc/os/<os name>/{rest id}\n```\n\nYou get a response of 200  OK if the delete is successful.
