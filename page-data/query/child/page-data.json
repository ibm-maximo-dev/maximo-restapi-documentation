All the query parameters for the child object collection operations follow a naming pattern that is `<mbo name>.<relation name>.<operator>`. The MBO name token refers to the parent MBO name for the child MboSet. The relation name is the relation name from the parent MBO to the child MboSet. The operator determines the type of inline operation that you are trying to apply on the child collection.\n\nThe following are the types of query parameters that are available:\n\n## Where Filter\n\nThe format of this query parameter is `<mbo_name>.<relation_name>.where`. This query sets the WHERE clause filter for the child object that is identified by the __mbo_name__ parent MBO and the __relation_name__ relation name. The syntax for the WHERE clause follows the `oslc.where` format with the target MboSet in context. For example, to filter on the `polines` in the MXPO object structure, use the follow format:\n\n```\nGET /oslc/os/mxapipo?oslc.select=ponum,status,poline{polinenum,itemnum,linec ost}&po.poline.where=itemnum=\"*\" and linecost>100.0\n```\n\nThe poline's that have an itemnum and line cost that is greater than 100 is shown and does not impact the selection of the PO records.\n\nTo support the __or__ clause on the __where__ clause (instead of the default __and__ clause), the query parameter `<mbo name>.<relation name>.opmodeor` which if set to `1`, treats the where clause specified above as an __or__ clause. This results in fetching all lines that have either a `itemnum` or a `linecost` that is greater than 100.\n\n## Timeline queries\n\nThe format for these query parameters are `<mbo_name>.<relation_name>.tlrange` for the time line range (eg `-3M` or `+2Y`) and `<mbo_name>.<relation_name>.tlattribute` (the attribute name of the child object on which to base the time-line on) following in the lines of the Timeline queries.\n\nThese query child object filters examines and limits the child objects in the inlined with the root object of the object structure. If you need to show those child objects in a list or tabular form and then page through and filter them, then you can use the relation name in the URI to traverse to that set. By traversing to the set, you can operate on the child collection independently and be able to page the collection.\n\n## Sorting\n\nThe format of this query parameter is `<mbo_name>.<relation_name>.orderBy`. This query sorts the child collection, follows the oslc.orderBy format, and is applied to the context of the child collection.\n\n```\nGET /oslc/os/mxapipo?oslc.select=ponum,status,poline{polinenum,itemnum,linecost}&po.poline.orderBy=-linecost&lean=1\n```\n\nThe results shows a descending sort list on the linecost for the poline collection.\n\n## Paging - Limit Filter\n\nThe format for this query parameter is `<mbo_name>.<relation_name>.limit`. This query sets the limit to the number of rows to be retrieved for the child collection.\n\n```\nGET /oslc/os/mxpo?oslc.select=ponum,status,poline{polinenum,itemnum,linecost}&po.poline.limit=1&lean=1\n```\n\nThe results show the limit the number of polines loaded to only 1 for each purchase order in the response.\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"09bf543d2357303fdef5729bc66cfc7e","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":168},"frontmatter":{"title":"Child objects"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Child objects\n---\n\nThis section explains how to filter, sort or limit (paging) child data sets while being inlined within their parent data set.
